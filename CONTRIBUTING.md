# Contribution guidelines

## Startup phase

The RSQKit is still under heavy development.
This means structure and content may still change a lot.
During this phase, we organize contributions through EVERSE internal documents and communication channels.
At some point we will likely move towards a more GitHub-centered contribution workflow, as outlined below.

Specifically, the main "location" for assigning authors to contributions is the spreadsheet.
Authors are to self organize (e.g., through Mattermost) in order to do collaborative writing.
At the end, a single PR is submitted.

## How to contribute 

**Note:** This section is work in progress

You can create new pages or report errors by opening a pull request:
  
 1. Open an issue with the type of content you would like to see in RSQKit.
  
 2. When you and the editor have agreed on what you will do, you can edit on the github repository by clicking on the pencil icon.
 
 3. When you are satisfied with with your first draft of the content, head to the “Propose changes” section at the end of the page and write a title and a brief explanation of your changes.

4. You will be directed to the Pull Reqest (PR) page, then click on "Create Pull Request", once submitted, the editors will then review your request.
  
5. You can request review, usually if a normall pull request, a review will be automatically requested. If your request is still in draft you can request a review.

6. Address editor's comments. when addressed, the editor will mark the conversation as "Resolved" and the proposed changes as "Approved".

## Ownership of content

No individual contributor or editor owns the project's content or has the authority to dictate its content. The RSQkit content is a collaborative effort, with contributions from many people. Decisions are made by consensus among the contributors and editors.

The content is periodically updated, meaning that if you create content for RSQKit, others may modify it without notifying you. However, RSQKit editors ensure that any changes are made for valid reasons. They strive to accommodate the legitimate concerns and diverse viewpoints of all contributors and ensure that the content reflects the most widely accepted consensus on any topic.

If you find any content unsatisfactory, please feel free to report about it by "creating an issue" request.
