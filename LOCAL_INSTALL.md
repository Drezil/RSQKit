# Local installation

**NOTE: under normal cirumstances it is not necessary to install the RSQKit locally**

The [RSQKit webpage](https://everse.software/RSQKit/) is automatically deployed on whenever changes are merged into the main branch of this repository. 
For every pull request, a preview version of the resulting site will be generated by [netlify](https://everse-rsqkit-testing.netlify.app/).
Therefore, it is genrally not necessary to install the RSQKit locally

Nevertheless, if you do wish to run the RSQKit website locally for development purposes, please follow the instructions below. 

## Installing the dependencies

The RSQKit uses [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the website based on the information in this repository. 
Jekyll is a Ruby Gem which can be installed on most systems. 

To install Jekyll, follow the installation instructions on https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

After succesfully installing Jekyll, you will need to clone the RSQKit repository (if you haven't already done so): 

```
git clone git@github.com:EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit.git
```

Next, you will need to install the dependencies of the RSQKit itself:

```
cd RSQkit
bundle install
```

## Building the RSQkit

Once the dependencies are sucessfully installed, you can build and run the RSQKit locally using the following command: 

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You can now access your local copy of the RSQKit on http://127.0.0.1:4000
