## The Problem <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

Describe the problem your software is trying to solve for your community.


## The Community <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

Describe the community that use your software (e.g. in your pilot, exeplar or however you wish to demark your community)
- Describe how the development is organised (e.g. is it one person, many, how are they organised)
- Who are the users - how experienced are they

## Technical Aspects <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- What is the tier(s) of software involved (e.g. Tier1: Analysis code; Tier 2: Prototype Tools; Tool 3: Research software infrastructure (including services))
- Techical specifications:
   - language(s)
   - any measures of the codebase (e.g. size, complexity, activity, how long it's been running)
   - deployment requirements (e.g. does it need a HPC - what compute/data or contextual requirements does it require)

## Software Practices <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- What practices do you use to develop the software (e.g. version control, contribution policy, other practices)

## Onboarding <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- How do you onboard new developers

   - Explain your main user stories (they main types of users, what they want to achieve and what the benefit to them is) 

## Tools <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- List any tools that you use to help you improve or assess the software quality of your code and a short description of how they help your software. (please refer to _data/tool_and_resource_list.yml and add any ones that use that are missing).

## Indicators <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- Which software indicators (see _date/quality_indicators.yml) do you feel that your software already achieves.
- Which software indicators and/or dimensions would you like to improve in your software
- What indicators do your users really care about

## FAIR & Open <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

 - FAIR: See https://fair-software.eu/ for inspiration: are there a repository and a license, do you have a community registry/catalogue where the code is available, is it citeable, do you have a “good software” checklist
 - Open: cover how you follow open source practices and oppen development practices

## Documentation <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

 - How is the documentation presented and maintained 

## Sustainability <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

- Are there any guides, training or other resources for the software produced for your community

## Recognition <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->
