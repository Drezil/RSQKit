# When referencing tools and resources use the following notion e.g. on Task pages -  {% tool "github" %} and not a markdown link
# for this to work the tool has to be listed here.
#
# - description: A short description of the purpose of the tool or resource
#   id: This is the id by which the tool will be references on other pages e.g. for GitHub the id is github so we use {% tool "github"%} to refer to it
#   name: This is the name of the tool or resource
#   registry: This is followed by a list of registry-tag:search-string combinations indented below which search for further information about this tool  
#       tess: <name>  <-- this will search the tess training registry using the term <name> - i.e. the tool name and return associated results - in this case around training on this tool
#   url: the homepage of the tool/resource
#   qualityIndicator:  Research Software Quality indicator (see indicators.yaml in this folder) associated with this tool. More than one quality indicator may be declared per tool (in a list)
